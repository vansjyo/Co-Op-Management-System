## Aim 
* To build an online system that helps us to buy, pay and order things from the Co-Op Society.
* The idea is to transform the coop into an online shopping market. 
* The app will let us know as to what is available in the co-op and what is not. 
* So we don’t have to search out for things out there and waste our time to go till there and find that the item we wish to purchase is available or not!
