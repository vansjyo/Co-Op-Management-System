# google-scholar-extended #

nodejs module for searching google scholar and listing profile information


## getting started ##

1. `npm install google-scholar-extended --save`
2. require the module `let scholar = require('google-scholar-extended')`
3. enter a search term

```
'use strict'

let scholar = require('google-scholar-extended')

scholar.search('chairmouse')
  .then(resultsObj => {
    console.log(resultsObj)
  })
```

If you would prefer to get all results at once rather than paginated, you can use scholar.all rather than scholar.search to retrieve all of the results. as in: 

```
'use strict'

let scholar = require('google-scholar-extended')

scholar.all('chairmouse')
  .then(resultsObj => {
    console.log(resultsObj) // this will have all ~112 results
  })
```

Get the information contained in a Google Scholar profile:

```
'use strict'

let scholar = require('google-scholar-extended')

scholar.profile('ukfCWkAAAAAJ')
  .then(resultsObj => {
    console.log(resultsObj)
  })
```

## resultsObj ##

the results obj has 4 fields:

* `count`: the approximate number of results Google Scholar found for your query
* `results`: an array of result objects
    - the `result` abject has several fields:
        - `title`
        - `url`
        - `authors`
        - `description` (search only)
        - `citedCount`
        - `citedUrl`
        - `relatedUrl` (search only)
        - `venue` (profile only)
        - `year` (profile only)
* `nextUrl`: (search only) the URL for the next set of results from google scholar
* `prevUrl`: (search only) the URL for the previous set of results from google scholar
* `next`: (search only) function that returns a promise which will resolve to a `resultsObj` containing the next results
* `previous`: (search only) function that returns a promise which will resolve to a `resultsObj` containing the previous results
